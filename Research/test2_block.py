largeText = """ do you have to practice who you want to be you know you don't wake up one morning and you're suddenly who you think you want to be you have to put some energy into it so if you want to be an honest person you have to be an honest person everyday even starting at 3:00 and 4:00 and 5:00 right if you're going to be a worker hard work doesn't just appear you have to practice hard work you have to practice effort and I also encourage them try to help them understand good things Don't Come Easy with that effort you know that's where you grow that's where growth of some of the best times when I've overcome a fear and you don't realize that when you're doing it but when you come out on the other side but more importantly I love them a lot and that's what I feel for all of you I want you guys to feel that in your lives so that you can be excellent because other people told me that I might not be able go to to do well in school for whatever reason I was always a good student I worked hard but I thought there was some magic that happened that made you really I didn't know that it was just plain old hard work so there were periods of Doubt for sure I think we are I have doubt day doubts don't go away you just learn how to deal with them you you start knowing yourself and you become more confident play the more successes you have the more chances you take you don't let the the failures or the stumbles Define you now body falls every now and then some people fall a lot and what I realized is that we have long lines if we're healthy and we do what we're supposed to do I'm 47 years old so think about it whatever mistake I made when I was 13 who cares so think about life as a long trajectory but at the same time you don't want to make huge mistakes because when you're young making big big mistakes can last forever right so you want to Choose Wisely but the stumbles the Lessons Learned that's part of life that that makes you grow but I I came to know that I didn't know that when I was your age I thought every every mistake was I'll never be able to I'll never get into school I'll never be at you know of course we all feel that way but just continue to work put the effort in and I think that has been some of what's helped me being first lady first of all is knowing who you are and being confident pushing Beyond other people's labels of you all right that's a big part that's what we do to each other all the time we don't even know each other and we already determined from one glance meeting one line one word One phrase this is who you are so you have to know who you you are before that and you and you live that reality and you keep living it out no matter what and if you're a good have good character and and good intentions that that ultimately shines through but in the end it's hard work and I'd like to work hard and I like to do good things and you practice that now and believe it or not I didn't know it prepare me to be the first lady of the United States I didn't know I guess I'm doing okay but you know what every day we just get up and keep doing what we think is the right sing read write read read read if the president were here one of his greatest strength is reading that's one of the reasons why he's a good communicator why he's such a good writer he's a voracious reader so we're trying to get our no matter what to just be to love reading and to challenge themselves with what they read not just read the gossip books but push themselves Beyond and do things that maybe they wouldn't do so I would encourage you all to to read read read read read just keep reading and writing is another our kids are learning the first draft means nothing you're going to do when you get to be a good writer you mark your own and if you come out with those skills and then anybody in the eye and say this is who I am it's a pleasure to meet you and that's one of the things try to do with our mentoring program with young girls my message to them is if you can walk into the White House and meet the first lady and say my name is how are you and look me in the eye and there's nothing you can't do that's why it's important if you guys walked here are sitting here in front of all these people asking questions using your voice you have to practice that these Arenas just show up again and again and then you just get used to it are the nerves go away and you start relaxing into your own abilities but it's practice when you are struggling and you start thinking about giving up I want you to remember something that my husband and I have talked about since we who started this journey nearly a decade ago something that is carried us through every moment in this white house and every moment of Our Lives and that is the power of Hope the belief that something better is always possible if you're work for it and fight for it is our fundamental belief in the power of hope that has allowed us to rise above the does a doubt and division of anger and fear that we have faced in our own lives and in the life of this country I hope that if we work hard enough and believe in ourselves then we can be whatever we dream regardless of the limitations That Others May lights on us the hope that when people see us for who we truly are maybe just maybe they play do his job at the city water plant the hope that one day his kids would go to college and have opportunities he never dreamed that's the kind of hope that every single one of us politicians parents preachers all of us need to be providing for a young people because that is what moves this country for it every single day I hope for the future and the when are young people to know that they matter that they belong so don't be afraid do you hear me young people don't be afraid be focused be determined be hopeful Howard Empower yourselves with a good education then get out there and use that education to build a country worthy of your boundless promise lead by example with hope never fear play figured something out that I thought I'd tell you about this took me like 30 years to figure out and I figured it out on this tour so there's this old idea you know that you have to rescue your father from The Bell play the whale right from some monster that's deep in the abyss you see that Pinocchio for example but it's very common idea and I figured out why that is I think so imagine that we already know from a clinical perspective that you know if you set out a path towards a goal which you want to do because you need and you need a path because that provides you with positive emotion right so you set up something as valuable so that implies a hierarchy you set up something is valuable why that you're going to do that instead of other things so that's kind of a sacrifice cuz you're sacrificing everything else to pursue that and then you experience a fair bit of positive emotion and meaning as you watch yourself move towards the goal and so the implication of that is the the better the goal the the more full and Rich your experience is going to be when you pursue it so that's one of the reasons that's one of the reasons for developing a vision and for fleshing yourself out philosophically because you want to aim at the highest goal that you can manage okay so you do that and then what you find is that as you move towards the goal there are certain things that that you have to accomplish that frighten you you know maybe you have to learn to be a better speaker have to be better to people around you or you have to learn some new skills and you're afraid of that whatever cuz it's going to stretch you if you if you pursue a goal and it's and so that put you up against challenges okay so all the clinical data indicates the opposite of safe spaces as Jonathan height has been pointing out that what you want to do identify something that someone is avoiding that they need to do because they're afraid you have them voluntary voluntarily confronted and so turn it down what you try to do if your behavior therapist is you break down the thing they're avoiding it to smaller and smaller pieces until you find a piece that small enough so they'll do it and it doesn't what happens is they don't get less afraid exactly they get braver they get looks like there's more of them you can and here's why so imagine you do something new and that's informative right there's information in the action and then you can incorporate that information and turn it into a skill and turn it into a transformation of your perceptions so there's more to you because you've tried something new that's one thing the second thing is there's good biological evidence for this now that if you put yourself in a new situation then new jeans for new proteins and build new neural structures and new nervous system structures same thing happens to some degree when you work out right cuz your muscles are responding to the load but you're there's a lot of potential you locked in your genetic code and then if you put yourself in a new situation then then that's produced by that particular situation unlocks those jeans and then build new parts of you and so that's very cool cuz who knows how much there is locked inside of you okay so now here's the idea so let's assume that that scales as you take on heavier and heavier floats and more and more of you you get more and more informed cuz you're doing more and more difficult things but more and more of you gets unlocked and so then what that would imply is that if you got to the point where you could look at the darkest thing so that would be the abyss right that would be the deepest of this if you could look at the harshest things like the most brutal parts of the suffering of the world and the malevolence of people in society you could look that look at that straight and and directly but that would turn you on maximally and so that's the idea of rescuing your father because imagine that you're like the potential composite of all your all the ancestral wisdom that's locked inside of you biologically but that's not going to come out at all unless you stress yourself unless you and the bigger the challenge you take on the more that's going to turn on and so that as you take on a broader and broader range of challenges and you push spell harder than more and more of what you could be turns on and that's equivalent to transforming yourself into the ancestral father into all because you're you're stop what would you call it you're the consequence of all these living beings that have come before you and that's all part of your biological potential play and then if you can push yourself then all of that clicks on and that turns you into who you could be that's and that's the representation of that positive ancestral father the point is your best strategic position is how my insufficient and how can I Rectify that that's what you've got and the thing is insufficient and you could rectify it both of those are within your grasp if you aim low enough one of the things that you see the that's another thing you keep saying aim low enough have a low enough bar why do you why do you mean that well let's say you've got a kid and you want the kid to improve you don't set them a bar that's so high that it's impossible for them to attain it you take a look at the can you think okay this kid's got this range of skill here's a challenge we can throw at him or her that exceeds their current level of skill but gives them a reasonable probability of success and so like I'm saying it tongue and cheek to some degree you know it's like but if you're but I'm doing it as an aid to humility it's like well I don't know how to start improving my life there's something you could do that you are regarding as trivial that that you could do that you would do that would result in an actual Improvement but it's not a big enough Improvement for you so you won't lower yourself enough to take the opportunity incremental steps I'm borrowing dropped it and drop the bar through your skull you know you think look when I started working out when I was a kid I was I was weighed about 130 lb and I was 6 ft 1 and I smoked a lot I wasn't in good shape I wasn't in good physical shape and I went to the gym and it was Bloody embarrassing you know and people would come over and help me with the goddamn weights here is how you're use this you know it was humiliated and maybe I was pressing 65 lb or something at that point you know but what am I going to do I'm going to lift up 150 lb and call myself right off the bat no I had to go in there and strip down and put my skinny goddamn self in front of the mirror and think son of a bitch there's all these monsters in the gym would be lifting weights 10 years and I'm struggling to get 50 lb off the bar tough luck for me but I could lift 50 lb and it wasn't very long until I could lift 75 and well you know how it but and I never injured myself when I was weightlifting and the reason for that was I never pushed myself past where I knew I could go and I pushed myself can I gain 35 lb of muscle in about 3 years in University I kind of had to quit cuz I was eating so goddamn much I couldn't stand it seemed like six meals a day it was just taking up how much time but there's a humility in determining what it is that The Wretched creature that you are can actually manage aim low and I don't mean don't aim and I don't mean don't aim up but you have to accept the fact that you can set yourself a goal that you can attain and there's not going to be much glory in it to begin with because if you're not in very good shape the goal that you could attain tomorrow isn't very glorious but it's a hell of a lot better than nothing and it beats the hell out of bitterness and play better than blaming someone else it's way less dangerous and you could do it and what's cool about it there's a statement in the New Testament it's call Matthew principal an economist use it to describe how the economy in the world Works to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken it's like what's very pessimistic in some sense because it means that as you start to fail you fail more and more rapidly but it also means that as you start to succeed you succeed more and more rapidly and so you well now you can lift 55 lb of 52.5 lb you think what the hell is that it's like it's one step on a very long journey so a small step today means put you in a position to take a slightly bigger step the next day and then that puts you in a position to a slightly bigger step the next day you do that for 2 or 3 years man you're starting to stride I found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks nothing Nelson Mandela said there is no passion to be found playing small in settling for a life that's less applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life I'm call people that told you to make sure you have something to fall back on make sure you got something to fall back on honey but I never understood that concept play something to fall back on if I'm going to fall I don't want to fall back on anything except my face I want to fall forward I figured at least this way I'll see what I'm going to hit full forward this is what I mean Reggie Jackson struck out 2600 times in his career the most in the history of baseball but you don't hear about workouts people remember the home runs for forward Thomas Edison Kentucky 1000 failed experiment did you know that I didn't know that because the 1,000 and first was the light bulb for forward every failed experiment is one step closer to success you've got to take risks and I'm sure you probably heard that before but I want to talk to you about why so important first you will fail at some point in your life accept it you will lose you will embarrass yourself you will suck at something there's no doubt about it and I know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony but hey I'm telling you embracing because it's inevitable and I should know in the acting business you fail all the time early on in my career I for a part in the Broadway musical perfect Road for me I thought except for the fact that I can't sing so I'm in the wings I'm about to go on stage but the guy in front of me he's singing like like like like like like Pavarotti he's just just my imagination by the Temptations that's what I came up with no I'm like hey I didn't know about musical theater in musical theater is Big so they can reach everyone play in the back of the stadium and I'm more from a realistic naturalistic kind of acting where you you know you actually talk to the person next to you so I don't know what my line was my line was hand me the cup in his line was well I will hand you the cup my dad the cup would be there be handed to you I said okay should I give you the cup back oh yes you should give it back to me because you know that is my cup and it should be given back to me I didn't get the job but here's the thing I didn't quit I didn't fall back I walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition I prayed I prayed and I pray that I continue to and spell and fail but it didn't matter because you know what there's an old saying you hang around the barbershop long enough sooner or later you're going to get so you will catch a break and I did catch a break last year play call fences on Broadway or someone talked about it won the Tony award and I didn't have to sing by the way but here's the kicker he was at the court theater it was at the same theater that spell that first audition 30 years prior the point is every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed but do you have the guts to fail here's my second point about failure if you don't fail you're not even trying I'll say it again if you don't fail you're not even trying my wife told me this great expression to get something you never had you have to do sing you never did Les Brown's a motivational speaker you made an analogy about this he says imagine you're on your deathbed and standing around your Deathbed the ghost representing your unfulfilled potential the ghost of the ideas you never acted on the ghost of the talents you didn't use and they're turn around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the Grave together so I asked you today how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes you've invested a lot in your education and people have invested in you and let me tell you the world needs your talents and does it ever I just got back Africa like 2 days ago so if I'm rambling on it's cuz I'm jet lag I just got back from South Africa it's beautiful country but there are places there with terrible part I need help in Africa is just the tip of the iceberg the Middle East needs your help Japan needs your help Alabama need your help Tennessee need your help Anna needs your help Philadelphia needs your help the world needs a lot and we need it from you I'm not speaking for the rest of us up here but I know I'm getting a little grayer we need it from you the young people cuz remember this so you got to get out there you got to give it everything you got whether it's your time your your your your your your talent your prayers play your Treasures because remember this you will never see a U-Haul behind a hearse you can't make it with you the Egyptians tried it and all they got was robbed so the question is what are you going to do with what you have I'm not talking about how much you have some of you a business major some of you are the when is Nurses sociologist some of you have money some of you have patience some of you have kindness some of you have loved some of you have the gift of long suffering whatever it is whatever your gift is what are you going to do with what you have right now here's my last point about failure sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going your life will never be a straight path I began at university has a pre-med student I took a course called the cardiac morphine still can't say it cardiac cardiac morphogenesis I couldn't read it I couldn't say it I sure couldn't pass it so then I decided to go into pre- that journalism and with no academic Focus my grades took off in their own Direction yeah down there was a 1.8 GPA one semester and the university very politely suggested that it might be better to take some time off I was 20 years old I was at my lowest point and then one day and I remember the exact day March 27th 1975 tell me my mother and her beauty shop my mother on the beauty shop up in Mount Vernon and there's there was this older woman who was considered one of the elders in the town and I didn't know personally but I was looking in the mirror and every time I looked in the mirror I could see her behind me and she was staring at me she just kept looking at me every time I looked at her she kept giving me these strange look so she finally took the dryer off her head and said she said something I'll never forget first of all she said somebody give me a piece of paper give me a piece of paper play youngboy I have a prophecy a spiritual prophecy she said you are going to travel the world speak to millions of people not mind you I'm 20 years old I'm flunked out of school in fact like a wise ass I'm thinking to myself maybe she's got something in that crystal ball about me back at the school next fall but maybe she was on to something at the YMCA Camp in Connecticut we put on a talent show for the campers and after the show another counselor came up to me and asked have you ever thought about acting you're good at that so when I got back to Fordham that fall I got in I changed my major once again for the last time and in the years that followed just as that woman prophesied I have traveled the world and I spoken to millions of people through my movies Millions who up till this day couldn't see me up till this day I couldn't see while I was talking to them and they couldn't see me they could only see the movie they couldn't see the real me but I see you today and I'm encouraged by what I see and I'm strengthened by what I see and I love what I see today I tell you three stories from my life that's it no big deal just three stories the first story it's about connecting the dots I dropped out of college after the first 6 months but then stayed around as a drop in for another 18 months it started before I was born my biological mother graduate student and she decided to put me up for adoption she felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates so everything was all set for me to be adopted at Birth by a lawyer and his wife except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl so my parents who are on a waiting list got a call in the middle of the night asking we got an unexpected baby boy do you want him they said of course my biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had she refused to sign the final adoption papers she only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college this was the start in my life and 17 years later I did go to college after 6 months I couldn't see the value in it I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how College was going to help me figure it out their entire life so I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay it was one of the best decisions I ever made the minute I dropped out I could stop taking dropping in on the ones that look far more interesting it wasn't all romantic I didn't I returned Coke bottles for the 5 cents to buy food with and I would walk the 7 miles across town Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hari Krishna Temple I loved it and much of what I stumbled into by following my Cur read college at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction every label on every drawer was beautifully and calligraphed because I had dropped out and I didn't have to take the normal classes I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this I learned about Sarah and Sans serif typefaces about combinations about what makes great typography great it was beautiful historical artistically sub and I found it fascinating none of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life proportionally spaced fonts if I had never dropped out I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college but it was looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future you have to trust in something your gut Destiny Life Karma whatever because believing that the dots will Worn Path and that will make all the difference my second story is about love and loss I was lucky I found what I the Macintosh a year earlier and I just turned 30 how can you get fired from a company you started well as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was but then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out when we what have been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating I really didn't know what to do for a few months I felt that I'd let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that I had dropped the Baton and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly I was a very public failure and I I've been rejected but I was still in love and so I decided to start over I didn't see it then the heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again I started a company named next another company named Pixar Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film Toy Story and is now the most successful annum studio in the world in a remarkable turn of events Apple bought next and I returned to Apple and the technology have a wonderful family together I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did you've got to find what you love and that is as true for work as is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do if you haven't found it yet keep looking and don't settle as with all matters of the heart you'll know when it just gets better and better as the years roll on so keep looking don't settle my third story is about death when I was 17 I read a quote that went something like if you live play as if it was your last someday you'll most certainly be right it made an impression on me and since then for the past 33 years the last day of my life would I want to do what I am about to do today and whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row I know I need to change something remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me fear of embarrassment or failure these things just there is no reason not to follow your heart no one wants die even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there and yet death is the destination we all share no one has escaped it and that is as it should be because death is very likely the single best invention of life it's life's change agent Sears out the old to make way for the new right now the new is you but someday not too long from now you will gradually become the old and be clear sorry to be so dramatic but it's quite true your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life don't be trapped by Dogma which is living with the results of other people's thinking don't let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary stay hungry stay foolish today I want to talk about what purpose but I'm not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose or Millennials we try to do that instinctively instead I'm here to tell you that finding your purpose isn't enough the challenge for Our Generation is to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose one of my favorite stories is when JF play went to go visit the NASA Space Center and he saw janitor holding a broom and he asked him what he was doing in the janitor replied Mr President I'm helping put a man on the moon purpose is that feeling that you are a part of something bigger than yourself that you are needed and the you have something better ahead to work for purpose is what creates true happiness and today I want to talk about three ways that we can create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose by taking on big meaningful projects together by redef bring a quality so everyone has the freedom to pursue their purpose and by building Community all across the world so first let's take on big meaningful projects our generation is going to have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars but we have the potential to do so much more than that every generation has its defining Works more than 300,000 people work to put stop man on the moon including that janitor millions of volunteers immunized children around the world against polio and millions of more people built the Hoover Dam and other great projects and now it's our generation's turn to do great things I know maybe you're thinking I don't know how to build a dam how to get a million people involved in anything well let me tell you a secret no one does when they begin ideas don't come out fully formed they only become clear as you work on them you just have to get started play music pop culture just get this all wrong the idea of a single Eureka moment is it dangerous lie it makes us feel inadequate because we feel like we haven't had ours yet and it prevents people with seeds of good ideas from ever getting started in the first place in our society we often don't take on big things because we're so afraid of making mistakes that we ignore all the things wrong today if we do nothing the reality is anything we do today is going to have some issues in the future but that can't stop us from getting I started so what are we waiting for it is time for our generation defining great works how about stop climate change before we destroy the planet and getting millions of people involved manufacturing and installing solar panels how about curing all diseases and getting people involved by asking volunteers to share their Health Data track their health data and share their genomes these achievements these are all within our reach let's do them all in a way that gives everyone in our society a role let's do big things not what's the current progress but to create purpose the second is redefining our idea of equality so everyone has the freedom to pursue their purpose now many of our parents had stable jobs throughout their careers but in our generation we're all a little whether we're starting our own projects or finding our role in another one and you know that's great because our culture of Entrepreneurship is how we create so much progress an entrepreneurial culture thrives when it is easy to try lots of new ideas Facebook wasn't the first thing salt I also built chat systems and games study tools and music players and I'm not alone JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before she finally wrote and published Harry Potter the greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail now today we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone when you don't have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic Enterprise we all lose and right now today our society is way over indexed on rewarding people when they're successful and we don't do nearly enough to make sure that everyone can take lots of different shots and let's face it there is something wrong with our system when I can leave here and make billions of dollars in 10 years while millions of students can't even afford to pay put their loans let alone start a business I know a lot of entrepreneurs and I don't know a single person who gave up on starting a business because they were worried they might not make enough money but I know too many people who haven't had the chance to pursue their dreams because they didn't have a cushion to fall back on if they fail every generation expands its definition of equality previous generations fought for the in civil rights they had the New Deal and great society and now it's time for our generation to Define play social contract we should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like GDP but by how many give us have a role we find meaningful we should explore ideas like Universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas and we're all going to make mistakes so we need a society that's less focused on locking us up in stigmatizing us when we do and as technology keeps on evolving we need a society that is more focused on providing continuous education through our lives and yes giving everyone volume to pursue purpose isn't going to be free people like me should pay for it and a lot of you are going to do really well and you should too but it's not just about giving money you can also give time and I promise you if you just take an hour or two a week that's all to give someone a hand and help them Reach their potential now maybe you're thinking that's a lot of time I'm not sure if I have that much time I used to think that we can all make time to give someone a hand let's give everyone the freedom to pursue purpose not just because it's the right thing to do we are all better for it purpose doesn't only come from work the third way we can create a sense of purpose for everyone is by building community and in our generation when we purpose for everyone we mean everyone in the world in a recent survey of Millennials around the world asking what most defines identity the most popular answer wasn't nationality ethnicity or religion it was citizen of the world that's a big every generation expands the circle of people we consider one of us and in our generation that now includes the whole world we understand that the great Arc of human history bends towards people coming together in greater numbers from tribes to cities to Nations to achieve things that we could not on our own we get that our greatest opportunities are now global we can be the generation that ends poverty that ends disease and we get that our greatest challenges need Global responses to no country can fight climate change alone or prevent pandemics progress now requires coming together not just as cities or nations but also as a global Community but we live in an unstable time there are people left behind by civilization across the whole world and it's tough to care about people in other places where we don't first feel good about our lives here at home purpose and stability and our own lives that we can start to open up and care about everyone else too and the best way to do that is the start building local communities right now change starts local even Google change starts small with people like us in our generation the struggle of whether we connect more what do we achieve our stop opportunities comes down to this your ability to build communities and create a world where every single person has a sense of purpose and I thought perhaps a tell a story of how I came to be here how did some of these things happen and maybe there's some lessons there because I often find myself wondering how did this happen so when I was young I didn't really know what I was going to do when I got older the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Odyssey advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic and and that's really true if you think if you go back say the things that we take for granted today would be you would be burned at the stake for you know being able to fly that's crazy not being able to see over long distances being able to communicate having effectively with with the internet a group mind of sorts and having access to all the world's information instantly from almost anywhere in the Earth this is stuff that that really would be magic it would be considered Magic there are many things that we take for granted today that weren't even imagined in times past they won't existential crisis cuz I was trying to figure out what does it all mean like what's the purpose thanks and I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the the knowledge of the world that we can do things that expand the scope and and scale of Consciousness then we're better able to ask the right questions and become more enlightened and and that's really the only way forward so I studied the physics and business because I figured in order to do a lot of these things you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how how the economy and you also need to go to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create something cuz it's very difficult to do something as as individual if it's if it's significant technology I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy density of of pickles basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced capacitor that that that that could serve as an alternative to batteries and that was a 95 and that's also when the internet started to happen and I thought well I can either pursue this technology where success Maybe or participate in the internet and and be part of it so I decided to drop out did some internet stop what one of which is PayPal and maybe it's helpful to say one of the things that was important than in the creation of PayPal was whiskers was to create an agglomeration of financial services so if you have one place where all your financial services this would be seamlessly integrated and and work smoothly and then we had like a little feature which was to do email payments and whenever we show the system off to someone which show the hard part which was the the glamour of financial services which is quite difficult to put together nobody was interested then we show people email payment focus on email payments and really try to make that work and that's what really got things to take off but if we hadn't if we hadn't responded to what people said then I probably would not have been successful so it is important to look for things like that and and focus on them when when you when you see them and get correct your prior assumptions what are some of the the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity it really wasn't play perspective of what's the rank order best way to to make money which is which is okay but what I think is going to most affect the future Humanity so the biggest terrestrial problem we've got is sustainable energy but the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner if we don't solve that dispensary is the century we're we're in deep trouble and then the other one being the extension of life beyond Earth to make life multiplanetary so that's what basis for the latter is the basis for for SpaceX and the former is the basis for Tesla and SolarCity and when I started SpaceX initially I thought that well if there's no way one could possibly start a rocket company I wasn't that crazy what is a way to increase NASA's budget that was actually my initial goal so I thought well if we can do a low-cost mission pause something called Mars Oasis which would land seeds with dehydrated with seeds and dehydrated nutrient gel and hydrate them upon landing and then you have the sort of money shot of green plants in a red background and the public tends to respond to presidents and superlatives and this would play first life on Mars the farthest that life's ever traveled far as we know and and I thought well that that would get people really excited and and therefore increase the masses budget so 3 * 2 to look at buying refurbished ICBM because that was the best deal and I can tell you it was very weird going there in in play 2001 2002 going to the Russian rocket forces and saying I'd like to buy two of your biggest Rockets but you can keep the nuke that's no more and that was 10 years ago I guess so they thought I was crazy but but I did have money so that was okay after making silver trips to to Russia I can't see inclusion that that actually my initial impression was what's wrong about it because of my Mitchell thought was well that there's not enough will to explore and expand beyond Earth and have a Mars base and that kind of thing particularly in the United States because the United States it is a nation of explorers the people from from other parts of the world I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration but if people think it's impossible then or it's going to completely break the federal budget then they're not going to do it so after my third trip I said okay well what we need to do here is try to solve the space transport problem and and started SpaceX and this this was against the advice of pretty much how to do all these things and and bring together the right team of people and we did all that and and then failed three times it was tough tough going just think about a rocket is the passing grade is 100% and you don't get to actually play test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be in so I think so the best analogy for for Rocket engineering is like if you want to create a really complicated but a software you can't run the software as an integrated hole and you can't run it on the computer it's intended to run on but the first time you put it all together and write it on that computer what's wrong with notebooks that's that's basically the essence of it so we missed the mark there that the first launch I was picking up bits of Rocket near the play launch actors but sad and we learned with with each successive flights and and were able to with the eventually with the lights in 2008 Rich orbit and that was also with the last bit of money that we had thank goodness that that happened I think the thing is four skip the song we got the Falcon went to a bit and then began to scale that up to to the Falcon 9 which is around a million pounds of thrust and we managed to get back to it and then develop play spacecraft which recently was able to Dock and return to Earth from the space station that was a White Knuckle Event so in order for Humanity to become a Frank civilization ultimately a multi-planet species and that's something I think it's it's it's it's vitally important and I hope that some of you will participate it's just really one of the most important things for the preservation and extension of Consciousness and it's worth noting the Earth has been around for 4 billion years and the civilization at least in terms of having writing has been around for 10 I'm actually I'm actually fairly optimistic about the future of birth so I don't want to I don't want to sort of people to have the wrong impression I think we're all about to die I think things will most likely be okay for a long time on Earth but not for sure but most likely but even if it's if it's sort of play 99% likely one percent chance is still it's still worth spending a habit of effort to ensure that we have backed up the biosphere and planetary redundancy if you completely baseball transport system to Mars which which is one of those things that's right on the borderline of of impossible but that's sort of the thing that we're going to try to achieve that with with SpaceX and then on the on the on the Tesla front the go with Tesla was really to try to show that what what electric cars can do because people had the wrong impression we had to change people's perception of an electric vehicle cuz it used to think of it as something that slow and ugly and head low range and like a golf cart and so that's why we created the Tesla roads that a show that you can be fast at and the calculations are very clear until you actually have the if you're going to create a company the first thing is try to do create a working prototype everything everything looks great on PowerPoint but if you have if you have an actual demonstration article even if it's in primitive form that's much much more effective for convincing people I think you guys turn off The Magicians of the 21st century don't like anything hold you back imagination is the limit and got there and create some magic thank you """
